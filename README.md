# Technical Challenge 1: Sitemap
## Review of Git, VSCode, Markdown, PRs
## Deadline: 11am on January 17th, 2025

## Branching & Pull Requests

Before you begin the work on the assignment, decide which team member is responsible for which task. Each team member must create a new branch, named appropriately based on their task. After a team member completes their task, they must create a Pull Request. 

Each PR must be reviewed by at least one member of your team and one member from another team. Reviewers should use the PR process to comment on the sitemap structure, Markdown formatting, or the report. Each person must review at least one PR. All PRs must be approved and merged after revisions have been satisfied.

## Website Analysis

Working in a small team analyze an existing website that was assigned to you. Take a note of the site's main sections, sub-pages, and navigation structure. Identify primary navigation links, major categories, subcategories, and footer content.

Now map out the website's hierarchy visually using a white board. Take a picture of your white board to include in your report.

## Sitemap in Markdown 

Using VSCode create a `sitemap/sitemap.md` document in Markdown that contains your sitemap, highlighting headers for main sections and lists for sub-pages. A simple template is below:

```
- Home
- About
  - Team
  - History
- Services
  - Consulting
  - Training
- Contact
```

Use Markdown headers, lists, and links where relevant.

## Report

Write a report, completing prompts provided in `writing/report.md`.
